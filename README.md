# Reed-Solomon FEC Coding
This repo contains a software-based example of a data transmission model implemented using non-binary recurrent sequences, 
based on Reed-Solomon noise-resistant codes. By representing its code combinations as counterparts of maximum-length sequences, 
we provide information frame recovery by any of their sequential or decimated parts.
# Introduction
As an alternative approach to the construction of dual Reed-Solomon codes or RS codes, we propose the use of a scheme:

</p>
where random blocks of information С1, С2, … Cm , forming a recurrent sequence {S}, are defined by the following expression:

$$S_i=C_1{e^i}_1+C_2{e^i}_2+\ \ldots\ +\ C_m{e_m}^i,\ {e^i}_j\in GF(2^k).\$$ 	(1)

The sequence {S} = (S0S1S2…Sn–1) of interval n, generated by circuit (Fig. 1), can be considered an analogue of the classical maximum-length sequence. 
It is known that the dual (n, m)-Reed-Solomon code can be effectively decoded by Galois field dual basis elements GF(2k). Consequently, in the absence 
of errors within the recurrent sequence, the initial phase included in its first m-elements can be determined from any consecutively accepted m-element section.

The application of this strategy in network protocols, namely UDP, is contingent upon the satisfaction of the following 
conditions:

1.	In order to provide a comprehensive ergonomic approach to the handling of byte structures, it is necessary to
determine the dimension of the Galois field GF(2k) in accordance with the divisibility of 8.
2.	The choice of the characteristic polynomial P(x) of order m, which is the primary factor determining the formation of
m-element sections of recurrent sequences, is also of significant consequence.	
3.	Decimation is a viable option in the event that the polynomial P(x) roots are conjugate roots, a condition that
ensures they belong to the field constructed on the basis of Q(x). For the purpose of streamlined evaluation, it is advisable
to fulfil the condition P(x) = Q(x). Consequently, the roots of P(x) will be equal to: e1=ε, e2=ε2, e3=ε4, e4=ε8, e5=ε16, e6=ε32,
e7=ε64, e8=ε128, where ε is the primal element of the field based on Q(x).

# Software implementation overview
The software implementation of the Reed-Solomon encoder is based on the splitting of the overall circuit into three main entities: an encoding section for one random block of 
information, an adder, and a common encoder. This is the union of the aforementioned entities.
By separating the tasks between these independent entities and creating separate section objects within the encoder, it is possible to model the behavior of different encoders 
based on different polynomials and fields.

To ensure that the receiver gets the file in the same condition as it was sent to it, the model includes Decoder module. Decoder provides information output from the encoder, 
the operation of which is described above. 

We decided to write a simulation model for the data transmission network to test the functionality of the proposed solution. As it was mentioned above, the use of recurrent sequences 
in networking technologies and problems related to data transmission is based on combining the described algorithms and realizations with the TCP/IP protocol stack, and API of the 
systems on whose side the task is performed. 
The system is based on the Receiver - Sender pair (Fig. 4), both of which contain UDP-socket for receiving and sending data, and TCP-socket for sending a message about accumulation 
of enough information for decoding.
